# soproJavaFx
Small demo application for seminar presentation

There are two projects: One without Spring implementation with only JavaFx and another project with JavaFx and Spring in combination.
This repo contains all code used in my presentation from early July. 

Disclamer: I'm not a pro or an expert in JavaFX. This project just covers the basic features of JavaFX.
